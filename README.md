# Solving decentralized ACPF by finite automatons
My solution for decentralized ACPF problem, using genetic algorithm to learn optimal behavior. Genetic algorithm teaches finite automatons to guide agents locally. Automatons found by this implementation are producing better solutions than an A* algorithm, while being similarily fast.
